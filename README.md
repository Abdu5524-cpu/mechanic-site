TO-DO:

1) Create a DB for bodywork quotes so if it's been asked before, then gpt can go there first (maybe)

1) Quote Form
    * Switch to a Chatbox UI after the user submits the quote form
    Replace the form with a conversational interface for follow-ups and clarifications.

    * Optional color-matching box for bodywork input
    So the user can tick off if they want to pay for the additional paint color matching.

    * Auto-scroll and focus behavior
    Ensure the UI scrolls to the latest message/input automatically like a real chat.

    * Loading indicators / typing animations
    Show that the AI is "thinking" to reduce user uncertainty.

    * Smooth transitions / animations
    For form-to-chat UI change and message delivery.


2) Integrate Index.js into routes pathway so all routes go to index.js and then to the necessary endpoint.

3) Create 'Book Appointment' form and integrate into front, back and create table in DB.

4) Integrate users for staff to see appointments and insider info.
